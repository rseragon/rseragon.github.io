# Stop abusing `cat`!
Abusing cats is a prevalent problem in the Linux user community. Users, ranging from know-nothing neophytes to all-knowing professionals, engage in cat abuse on a daily basis, whether in their scripts or simple terminal commands.

### Steps to prevent abuse
1. **Utilize command line arguments instead of cat piping:**
For example, we generally read the file using `cat`, and then we pipe the output to input of 
the other command. Which kinda looks like this
```console
cat file | grep pattern
```
The above pattern reads the file using `cat` and then pipes the output as the input for `grep`. This is a prominent example of cat abuse, where the use of cat is involuntary. The same command can be rewritten as:
```console
grep pattern file
```
Both of the commands provide the same output but the first command abuses the `cat`!

2. **File redirection vs cat input:**
File redirection in Unix-based systems is a more concise and efficient way to leverage file input into commands compared to the age-old method of using cat piping.
```console
cat file1 | command arg1
```
```console
command arg1 < file1 
```
Though, these two commands culminate in the same output, the second command ensures that cat is not abused!

### Places of ignorance
Although, `cat` abuse is a concerning practice, there are few situtaions where
voilation of the rules is acceptable.
Like

- **`cat` piping over multiple redirections**<br/>
Consider this command
```
command < input_file | command2 > out | command3 < input_file
```
Compared to the above command, the below command is more clear
```
cat input_file | command1 | command2 > out
```


## Reality of `cat` abuse
In actuality, this is considered [UUOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)#Useless_use_of_cat) (Useless use of cat).
 In situations where piping the read file into stdin is unnecessary, it is generally better to avoid it.
Doing so only increases the complexity of execution. If the command itself is capable of reading the file, then using `cat` to read the file and subsequently sending it into stdin is pointless.

Even though the prevelance of `cat` abuse is quite persistent throughout the Linux user community, many of them
do consider it irrelavent and choose to ignore it, as, in reality, it does not affect the day-to-day execution by any means.

Now, we get to ask ourselves a question

## _Do we abuse the `cat` or not?_

Whether you decide to answer 'yes' or 'no,' I'll leave that up to your discretion.
